# love-rms-lands

scenario like editor for land generation... it's going to be more like paint than an actual editor, and even calling it paint is pushing it. something more primitive?

currently just a mockup of a ui and scrollable map

Planned features:

3x3, 5x5, 7x7 brush

export to lua file (working file)

export to aoe2 definitive edition random map script

Requires love2d

To run program without using .love file, call love . at the top level directory with main.lua and the textures folder. 

If you do not have love2d installed, you can download it here: https://love2d.org/
